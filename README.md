# Eat The Burger

## Description

"Eat The Burger" is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
